# h-DQN-MD Implementation

This repo contains an implementation of Hierarchical Masked Delta DQN, h-DQN-MD, as well as DQN and h-DQN.

h-DQN-MD uses observation masking and TDÎ´ loss to achieve better scalability and performance over regular h-DQN, as covered in my masters thesis.

The project can be run using the [crete](https://github.com/geist-2501/crete) python package.
